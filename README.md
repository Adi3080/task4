In this project, various SQL aggregate functions and clauses are demonstrated using a student table. 
The COUNT function is used to count the number of department entries, with aliasing applied as dept_count to improve readability. 
The SUM function calculates the total marks obtained by all students, while the MIN and MAX functions help identify the lowest and highest marks in the dataset, respectively. 
The AVG function computes the overall average marks. Further, the GROUP BY clause is used to group students department-wise and calculate the average marks for each department. 
To refine this grouped data, the HAVING clause is applied to filter and display only those departments where the average marks are greater than 70. 
These queries are useful for analyzing grouped data and performing statistical operations on student records
